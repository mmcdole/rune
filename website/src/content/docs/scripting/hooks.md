title: Hooks & Events
description: The event pipeline under everything else. Intercept input, output, prompts, and system events.

Hooks are the lowest-level scripting surface: every line in or out of the
client flows through them, and the core's own behavior (trigger dispatch,
echo styling, command handling) is implemented as hook handlers you can see
in `/hooks`.

```lua
rune.hooks.on(event, handler, opts?)
```

Unlike triggers, aliases, and timers, a hook handler is always a Lua
function; there is no string form. What the function receives and what its
return value means depend on the event.

## Data-flow events

Handlers run in priority order:

| Event | Handler receives | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `input` | submitted text, context | Return `false` to consume; other returns are ignored. `context.mode` is read-only and always `"command"` or `"verbatim"`. |
| `output` | a line object | `false` gags, a string rewrites. The core handler runs triggers at priority 100. |
| `prompt` | a line object | Same, for prompt fragments. |
| `echo` | one line of the local echo | Like `output` but a plain string. The `> ` prefix is the core handler; replace it if you like. |

For `output`, `prompt`, and `echo`, rewrites chain: a handler returning a
string replaces the text for every subsequent handler, and `false` stops the
chain (gags the line or hides the echo). For `input`, only `false` means
anything. `input` fires once per submission: in verbatim mode `text` is the
whole draft and may contain newlines. Handlers that only take `text` keep
working — Lua ignores the extra argument. To rewrite normal command input,
use an [alias](/scripting/aliases/).

```lua
-- Timestamp every line, after triggers have run
rune.hooks.on("output", function(line)
    return rune.style.gray(os.date("[%H:%M] ")) .. line:raw()
end, { priority = 150 })
```

```lua
-- A panic key: swallow all input while active
local locked = false
rune.hooks.on("input", function(text, context)
    -- context.mode is "command" or "verbatim"; both pass through here
    if locked and text ~= "/unlock" then return false end
end, { priority = 1 })
```

The core handler at priority 100 applies aliases, `;` separators, `#N`
repeats, and slash commands when `context.mode == "command"`. For
`"verbatim"`, it skips all of that and sends each line of the draft as-is.

## Notification events

All handlers run and returns are ignored. The ones you'll reach for
most: `connected` (address), `disconnected`, and `ready` (boot and
reload complete). The full catalog — connection lifecycle, reload,
errors, GMCP — is in the
[rune.hooks reference](/reference/api/hooks/#notification-events).

```lua
rune.hooks.on("connected", function(addr)
    rune.send("Ragnar")  -- or see the auto-login cookbook recipe
end)
```

## Priorities in practice

The core's data-flow handlers sit at priority 100. Run before them
(priority below 100) to intercept raw input and output. Run after them
(priority above 100) to see the post-trigger result; that is where the
session logger lives (priority 200, named `log-output`). One exception: the
core `input` handler always consumes, so `input` handlers above priority
100 never run.

## Options

Hooks take the [common options](/scripting/model/#options) `name`,
`group`, and `priority` (order among handlers for the event, lower
first, default 50).

## Managing

Every constructor returns a handle with `:enable()`, `:disable()`, and
`:remove()`. By name: `rune.hooks.disable/enable/remove(name)` — the full
management suite is in the [API reference](/reference/api/#managing). In
the client, `/hooks` lists every handler, including the core's own, since
the client registers its behavior through the same API.

## Gotchas

- A handler that throws is skipped for that line and reported once; it
  cannot abort the chain. Three consecutive failures
  [quarantine](/scripting/model/#quarantine) it.
- Handlers may register or remove hooks mid-dispatch safely; the chain
  iterates a snapshot.
